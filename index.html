        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Observatory Director at the
            University of North Georgia in Dahlonega, Georgia, USA.
            My research is focused on the structure and evolution of low-mass stars, where low mass refers
            to stars with masses between 8% and 120% of the mass of our Sun. In particular, I am interested
            in whether magnetic fields or magnetic activity (such as starspots, seen below on the Sun) play a significant role in determining the
            observed properties of stars. To do this, I compare predictions from theoretical stellar
            models to observations of both single stars and stars in binary systems (specifically eclipsing
            binaries). You can read about this <a href="research.html">here</a>.

            <strong>13 Jul 2018</strong><br/>
            Congratulations to Maxwell Roberts, who will be starting as an undergraduate at Vassar College this
            fall. Maxwell was a member of UNG's Stellar Evolution Research Group computing grids of magnetic 
            stellar evolution models. We're losing a great team member, but we're super exicited for Maxwell as 
            he begins a new adventure at Vassar! Keep an eye out for Maxwell's paper (coming soon to RNAAS).

            UNG's Stellar Evolution Research Group is hiring one UNG undergraduate to act as a full-time summer
            resident observer at the North Georgia Astronomical Observatory during summer 2018. The position
            is supported by a Georgia Space Grant Consortium research grant.

            UNG's Stellar Evolution Research Group is hiring one UNG undergraduate for summer 2018 to investigate how
            starspots affect the properties of young, low-mass stars. The project is supported by a
            Faculty-Undergraduate Summer Engagement
            (<a href="https://ung.edu/undergraduate-research-creative-activities/research-opportunities/at-ung/fuse/index.php" target="_blank">FUSE</a>)
            award from UNG's Center for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities
            (<a href="https://ung.edu/undergraduate-research-creative-activities/index.php" target="_blank">CURCA</a>).

            Dr. Feiden is part of a team awarded a $430,000 Astrophysics Theory Grant by NASA to explore helium
            concentrations in galactic globular clusters. UNG was awarded $60,000 to support a UNG undergraduate
            researcher for each of the next 3 summers (2018 - 2020).

            Khian Skidmore is now a McNair Scholar! Khian, a junior physics major at UNG and member of UNG's stellar
            evolution research group, was awarded a scholarship through UNG's Ronald E. McNair
            Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program. Congratulations to Khian!

            <strong>27 Oct 2017</strong><br/>
            Team members Jessica Hamilton, Max Roberts, Khian Skidmore, and Dr. Feiden attended
            the Georgia Regional Astronomy Meeting (GRAM) at the University of Georgia. Jessica and
            Max presented posters showing results of their research projects. Learn more about their
            work on our <a href="research.html">research group page</a>, or take a look at their posters,
            which are archived on Zenodo:
